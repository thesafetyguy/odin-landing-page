The Odin Project - Landing Page

The project and website is designed for the purpose of
completing The Odin Project's established curriculum.

It does not utilize techniques or methods that stray from
the given materials up until this point with the exception
of utilizing BEM classes for organization. No tokens or
variables are used.

All images are wholly owned and licensed by Grade 5 Media.
All duplication, modification or distribution of these
materials are strictly forbidden. The images used here
are strictly for styling or themeing purposes without
digging for other content to have fun on a project.

That being said, feel free to review my code. Always
happy to take criticism and feedback. My goal is
efficient, readable and maintainable code. Keep in
mind if you are reading this and wanting to offer
your feedback that "efficient and maintable" is hard
to achieve without using more tools(like tokens).

Thanks for your coming to my TedTalk! Enjoy.
